# BertQA

This is a working file for the Kaggle Tensor 2.0 Question Answering Kaggle competition
Currently I am trying to convert the https://www.kaggle.com/abhinand05/bert-for-humans-tutorial-baseline to run on google Colab
There is code at bottom of the notebook that allows me to log into the Colab machine with SSH. This is not part of the project. Please ignore.
